.SH NAME
ExtUtils::PL2Bat \- Batch file creation to run perl scripts on Windows
.SH VERSION
.IX Header "VERSION"
version 0.005
.SH OVERVIEW
.IX Header "OVERVIEW"
This module converts a perl script into a batch file that can be executed on Windows/DOS\-like operating systems.  This is intended to allow you to use a Perl script like regular programs and batch files where you just enter the name of the script [probably minus the extension] plus any command-line arguments and the script is found in your \fBPATH\fR and run.
.SH FUNCTIONS
.IX Header "FUNCTIONS"
.SS pl2bat(%opts)
.IX Subsection "pl2bat(%opts)"
This function takes a perl script and write a batch file that contains the script. This is sometimes necessary
.IP \(bu 8
\&\f(CW\*(C`in\*(C'\fR
.Sp
The name of the script that is to be batchified. This argument is mandatory.
.IP \(bu 8
\&\f(CW\*(C`out\*(C'\fR
.Sp
The name of the output batch file. If not given, it will be generated using \f(CW\*(C`in\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`stripsuffix\*(C'\fR.
.IP \(bu 8
\&\f(CW\*(C`ntargs\*(C'\fR
.Sp
Arguments to invoke perl with in generated batch file when run from
Windows NT.  Defaults to '\-x\ \-S\ \f(CW%0\fR\ %*'.
.IP \(bu 8
\&\f(CW\*(C`otherargs\*(C'\fR
.Sp
Arguments to invoke perl with in generated batch file except when
run from Windows NT (ie. when run from DOS, Windows 3.1, or Windows 95).
Defaults to '\-x\ \-S\ "%0"\ \f(CW%1\fR\ \f(CW%2\fR\ \f(CW%3\fR\ \f(CW%4\fR\ \f(CW%5\fR\ \f(CW%6\fR\ \f(CW%7\fR\ \f(CW%8\fR\ \f(CW%9\fR'.
.IP \(bu 8
\&\f(CW\*(C`stripsuffix\*(C'\fR
.Sp
Strip a suffix string from file name before appending a ".bat"
suffix.  The suffix is not case-sensitive.  It can be a regex or a string and a trailing
\&\f(CW\*(C`$\*(C'\fR is always assumed).  Defaults to \f(CW\*(C`qr/\e.plx?/\*(C'\fR.
.IP \(bu 8
\&\f(CW\*(C`usewarnings\*(C'\fR
.Sp
With the \f(CW\*(C`usewarnings\*(C'\fR
option, \f(CW" \-w"\fR is added after the value of \f(CW$Config{startperl}\fR.
If a line matching \f(CW\*(C`/^#!.*perl/\*(C'\fR already exists in the script,
then it is not changed and the \fB\-w\fR option is ignored.
.IP \(bu 8
\&\f(CW\*(C`update\*(C'\fR
.Sp
If the script appears to have already been processed by \fBpl2bat\fR,
then the script is skipped and not processed unless \f(CW\*(C`update\*(C'\fR was
specified.  If \f(CW\*(C`update\*(C'\fR is specified, the existing preamble is replaced.
.SH ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
.IX Header "ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS"
This code was taken from Module::Build and then modified; which had taken it from perl's pl2bat script. This module is an attempt at unifying all three implementations.
