.SH DESCRIPTION
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
Pod::Text::Overstrike is a simple subclass of Pod::Text that highlights
output text using overstrike sequences, in a manner similar to nroff.
Characters in bold text are overstruck (character, backspace, character)
and characters in underlined text are converted to overstruck underscores
(underscore, backspace, character).  This format was originally designed
for hard-copy terminals and/or line printers, yet is readable on soft-copy
(CRT) terminals.
.PP
Overstruck text is best viewed by page-at-a-time programs that take
advantage of the terminal's \fBstand-out\fR and \fIunderline\fR capabilities, such
as the less program on Unix.
.PP
Apart from the overstrike, it in all ways functions like Pod::Text.  See
Pod::Text for details and available options.
.SH BUGS
.IX Header "BUGS"
Currently, the outermost formatting instruction wins, so for example
underlined text inside a region of bold text is displayed as simply bold.
There may be some better approach possible.
.SH COMPATIBILITY
.IX Header "COMPATIBILITY"
Pod::Text::Overstrike 1.01 (based on Pod::Parser) was the first version of
this module included with Perl, in Perl 5.6.1.
.PP
The current API based on Pod::Simple was added in Pod::Text::Overstrike
2.00, included in Perl 5.9.3.
.PP
Several problems with wrapping and line length were fixed as recently as
Pod::Text::Overstrike 2.04, included in Perl 5.11.5.
.PP
This module inherits its API and most behavior from Pod::Text, so the details
in "COMPATIBILITY" in Pod::Text also apply.  Pod::Text and Pod::Text::Overstrike
have had the same module version since 4.00, included in Perl 5.23.7.  (They
unfortunately diverge in confusing ways prior to that.)
