.SH NAME
Encode::Supported \-\- Encodings supported by Encode
.SH DESCRIPTION
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
.SS "Encoding Names"
.IX Subsection "Encoding Names"
Encoding names are case insensitive. White space in names
is ignored.  In addition, an encoding may have aliases.
Each encoding has one "canonical" name.  The "canonical"
name is chosen from the names of the encoding by picking
the first in the following sequence (with a few exceptions).
.IP \(bu 2
The name used by the Perl community.  That includes 'utf8' and 'ascii'.
Unlike aliases, canonical names directly reach the method so such
frequently used words like 'utf8' don't need to do alias lookups.
.IP \(bu 2
The MIME name as defined in IETF RFCs.  This includes all "iso\-"s.
.IP \(bu 2
The name in the IANA registry.
.IP \(bu 2
The name used by the organization that defined it.
.PP
In case \fIde jure\fR canonical names differ from that of the Encode
module, they are always aliased if it ever be implemented.  So you can
safely tell if a given encoding is implemented or not just by passing 
the canonical name.
.PP
Because of all the alias issues, and because in the general case 
encodings have state, "Encode" uses an encoding object internally 
once an operation is in progress.
.SH "Supported Encodings"
.IX Header "Supported Encodings"
As of Perl 5.8.0, at least the following encodings are recognized.
Note that unless otherwise specified, they are all case insensitive
(via alias) and all occurrence of spaces are replaced with '\-'.
In other words, "ISO 8859 1" and "iso\-8859\-1" are identical.
.PP
Encodings are categorized and implemented in several different modules
but you don't have to \f(CW\*(C`use Encode::XX\*(C'\fR to make them available for
most cases.  Encode.pm will automatically load those modules on demand.
.SS "Built-in Encodings"

UTF\-7 is a special encoding which "re-encodes" UTF\-16BE into a 7\-bit
encoding.  It is implemented separately by Encode::Unicode::UTF7.
.SS "Encode::Byte \-\- Extended ASCII"

Encode::Byte implements most single-byte encodings except for
Symbols and EBCDIC. The following encodings are based on single-byte
encodings implemented as extended ASCII.  Most of them map
\&\ex80\-\exff (upper half) to non-ASCII characters.

Since there are so many, they are presented in table format with

the table is sorted in order of ISO\-8859 and the corresponding vendor

.SS "gsm0338 \- Hentai Latin 1"
.IX Subsection "gsm0338 - Hentai Latin 1"
GSM0338 is for GSM handsets. Though it shares alphanumerals with
ASCII, control character ranges and other parts are mapped very
differently, mainly to store Greek characters.  There are also escape
sequences (starting with 0x1B) to cover e.g. the Euro sign.
.PP
This was once handled by Encode::Bytes but because of all those
unusual specifications, Encode 2.20 has relocated the support to
Encode::GSM0338. See Encode::GSM0338 for details.
.IP "gsm0338 support before 2.19" 2
.IX Item "gsm0338 support before 2.19"
Some special cases like a trailing 0x00 byte or a lone 0x1B byte are not
well-defined and \fBdecode()\fR will return an empty string for them.
One possible workaround is
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&   $gsm =~ s/\ex00\ez/\ex00\ex00/;
\&   $uni = decode("gsm0338", $gsm);
\&   $uni .= "\exA0" if $gsm =~ /\ex1B\ez/;
.Ve
.Sp
Note that the Encode implementation of GSM0338 does not implement the
reuse of Latin capital letters as Greek capital letters (for example,
the 0x5A is U+005A (LATIN CAPITAL LETTER Z), not U+0396 (GREEK CAPITAL
LETTER ZETA).
.Sp
The GSM0338 is also covered in Encode::Byte even though it is not
an "extended ASCII" encoding.

.SH "Encoding vs. Charset \-\- terminology"
.IX Header "Encoding vs. Charset -- terminology"
We are used to using the term (character) \fIencoding\fR and \fIcharacter
set\fR interchangeably.  But just as confusing the terms byte and
character is dangerous and the terms should be differentiated when
needed, we need to differentiate \fIencoding\fR and \fIcharacter set\fR.
.PP
To understand that, here is a description of how we make computers
grok our characters.
.IP \(bu 2
First we start with which characters to include.  We call this
collection of characters \fIcharacter repertoire\fR.
.IP \(bu 2
Then we have to give each character a unique ID so your computer can
tell the difference between 'a' and 'A'.  This itemized character
repertoire is now a \fIcharacter set\fR.
.IP \(bu 2
If your computer can grow the character set without further
processing, you can go ahead and use it.  This is called a \fIcoded
character set\fR (CCS) or \fIraw character encoding\fR.  ASCII is used this
way for most cases.
.IP \(bu 2
But in many cases, especially multi-byte CJK encodings, you have to
tweak a little more.  Your network connection may not accept any data
with the Most Significant Bit set, and your computer may not be able to
tell if a given byte is a whole character or just half of it.  So you
have to \fIencode\fR the character set to use it.
.Sp
A \fIcharacter encoding scheme\fR (CES) determines how to encode a given
character set, or a set of multiple character sets.  7bit ISO\-2022 is
an example of a CES.  You switch between character sets via \fIescape
sequences\fR.
.PP
Technically, or mathematically, speaking, a character set encoded in
such a CES that maps character by character may form a CCS.  EUC is such
an example.  The CES of EUC is as follows:
.IP \(bu 2
Map ASCII unchanged.
.IP \(bu 2
Map such a character set that consists of 94 or 96 powered by N
members by adding 0x80 to each byte.
.IP \(bu 2
You can also use 0x8e and 0x8f to indicate that the following sequence of
characters belongs to yet another character set.  To each following byte
is added the value 0x80.
.PP
By carefully looking at the encoded byte sequence, you can find that the
byte sequence conforms a unique number.  In that sense, EUC is a CCS
generated by a CES above from up to four CCS (complicated?).  UTF\-8
falls into this category.  See "UTF\-8" in perlUnicode to find out how
UTF\-8 maps Unicode to a byte sequence.
.PP
You may also have found out by now why 7bit ISO\-2022 cannot comprise
a CCS.  If you look at a byte sequence \ex21\ex21, you can't tell if
it is two !'s or IDEOGRAPHIC SPACE.  EUC maps the latter to \exA1\exA1
so you have no trouble differentiating between "!!". and "\ \ ".
.SH "Encoding Classification (by Anton Tagunov and Dan Kogai)"

bit version and an 8 bit version.
.Sp
The 7 bit version switches character set via escape sequence so it
cannot form a CCS.  Since this is more difficult to handle in programs
than the 8 bit version, the 7 bit version is not very popular except for
iso\-2022\-jp, the \fIde facto\fR standard CES for e\-mails.
