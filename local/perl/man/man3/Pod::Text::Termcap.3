.SH NAME
Pod::Text::Termcap \- Convert POD data to ASCII text with format escapes
.SH SYNOPSIS
.IX Header "SYNOPSIS"
.Vb 2
\&    use Pod::Text::Termcap;
\&    my $parser = Pod::Text::Termcap\->new (sentence => 0, width => 78);
\&
\&    # Read POD from STDIN and write to STDOUT.
\&    $parser\->parse_from_filehandle;

.SH DESCRIPTION
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
Pod::Text::Termcap is a simple subclass of Pod::Text that highlights output
text using the correct termcap escape sequences for the current terminal.
Apart from the format codes, it in all ways functions like Pod::Text.  See
Pod::Text for details and available options.
.PP
This module uses Term::Cap to find the correct terminal settings.  See the
documentation of that module for how it finds terminal database information
and how to override that behavior if necessary.  If unable to find control
strings for bold and underscore formatting, that formatting is skipped,
resulting in the same output as Pod::Text.
.SH COMPATIBILITY
.IX Header "COMPATIBILITY"
Pod::Text::Termcap 0.04 (based on Pod::Parser) was the first version of
this module included with Perl, in Perl 5.6.0.
.PP
The current API based on Pod::Simple was added in Pod::Text::Termcap 2.00.
Pod::Text::Termcap 2.01 was included in Perl 5.9.3, the first version of Perl
to incorporate those changes.
.PP
Several problems with wrapping and line length were fixed as recently as
Pod::Text::Termcap 4.11, included in Perl 5.29.1.
.PP
Pod::Text::Termcap 4.13 stopped setting the TERMPATH environment variable
during module load.  It also stopped falling back on VT100 escape sequences if
Term::Cap was not able to find usable escape sequences, instead producing
unformatted output for better results on dumb terminals.  The next version to
be incorporated into Perl, 4.14, was included in Perl 5.31.8.
.PP
This module inherits its API and most behavior from Pod::Text, so the details
in "COMPATIBILITY" in Pod::Text also apply.  Pod::Text and Pod::Text::Termcap
have had the same module version since 4.00, included in Perl 5.23.7.  (They
unfortunately diverge in confusing ways prior to that.)
